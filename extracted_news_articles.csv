What follows is an account of my experiences from about one year of
roughly daily R usage. It started out as a list of things that I liked
and disliked about the language, but eventually grew to be something
huge. Once the list exceeded ten thousand words, I knew that it must be
published. By the time I was done, it had nearly tripled in length. It
took five months of weekends just to get it all in R Markdown.

Some of these time machines make perfect logical sense (as far as time travel goes). Others, not so much. Either way, the genre provides huge opportunities for creativity, and some of the time machines that have been dreamed up by writers aiming for absurdity, realism, or just plain old awesomeness have inspired audiences and stood the test of time (which is rather fitting when you think about it).;collider.com;3183;gaming;US;en;['Ed Brown'];https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pjimage-(9)-4.jpg;False;@collider;6.8346767;86b8ebb21188a294c843bcae1f071900

C++ itself is ""starting to enable parallel algorithms and asynchronous execution as first-class components of the language,"" said Stephen Jones, CUDA architect at Nvidia, during a break-out session on CUDA at Nv's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) this week.
""I think, by far the most exciting move for standard C++ in that direction,"" Jones added.
